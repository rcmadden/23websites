## About
Hello I'm Russia Madden and I'm making 23 internet projects.  

I'm constantly coming up with ideas I want to solve with code.  Whether it is an app, browser plug in, web page, utility, game etc. 

I keep a list on my phone.  The problem is, I never check any off.  The list just get's longer every year.

I liked the idea of those build x projects in x months challenges going around the first of every year and wanted to challenge myself.
However, having a full time job that is NOT as a full stack developer I wanted to pace myself, as I will be learning as I go.

The goal of this site is to build as many of these ideas as I can, releasing a new project every couple of months.

Why 23?
I got the idea last year, and am a huge Michael Jordan fan. I picked the launch date of the first day of spring becasue it's a palendrome in the long and short US date formats 3.20.2023 and 3.20.23.
And yes, I bought yet another domain to add to my list.  
It also gives me an excuse to throw some sneakers on the website.
